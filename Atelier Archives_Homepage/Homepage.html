                <h3> Three Sunflowers (1888) | Vincent van Gogh </h3>
                <p>Van Gogh relied heavily on sunflowers as an inspiration and source of income, painting them at an increasingly rapid pace to develop his color sense and brushwork as well as provide him with income. Van Gogh often painted roses, irises, lilacs, and carnations in his paintings of nature. He enjoyed painting them at any stage in their development - from fresh blooms to withered petals - so as to capture its beauty in his art. This painting showcases Van Gogh's free-figuration style beautifully.</p>

                <h3> A Basket of Roses (1890) | Henri Fantin-Latour </h3>
                <p>Henri Fantin-Latour was known for his paintings of roses, conjuring images of nineteenth-century drawing rooms and cultured discussion through their floral arrangements. This still life of roses and irises shows off his use of vibrant, clashing hues.</p>

                <h3> La Grenouillère (1869) | Claude Monet </h3>
                <p>Five years before Impressionism's official debut, this painting of visitors to a boating and bathing resort on the Seine River near Paris reveals the seeds of the movement. Monet created this work alongside his friend and fellow painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, who produced a similar canvas. Working together en plein air, the pair presented a view of Paris's bourgeoisie at play.</p>

                <h3> A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte (1884) | Georges Seurat </h3>
                <p>One of the most widely recognized examples of Pointillism. This monumental painting, created on a large canvas, captures a serene scene of Parisians relaxing on the banks of the River Seine. Seurat's use of the Pointillist technique, where small dots of color are applied to the canvas, allows for a vibrant interplay of light and color.</p>

                <h3> Morning, Interior (1890) | Maximilien Luce </h3>
                <p> Morning, Interior is a stunning example of early pointillism and divisionism, depicting Luce's friend and fellow artist Gustave Perrot getting ready in the morning. This painting is composed of many individually colored dots, mostly in orange, red, yellow, and blue, which create an image that has incredible detail.</p>

                <h3> Portia Wounding Her Thigh (1664) | Elisabetta Sirani </h3>
                <p>“Portia Wounding Her Thigh” is a Baroque painting by the Italian artist Elisabetta Sirani, completed in 1664. The painting depicts a scene from Plutarch's “Parallel Lives,” in which Portia, the wife of Marcus Brutus, cuts her own thigh to prove her trustworthiness to her husband. Sirani's painting captures the intensity and drama of the moment, with Portia shown in a pose reminiscent of classical sculpture and with a look of determination on her face.

The composition of the painting is simple yet striking, with Portia shown in a white dress against a dark background. The use of light and shadow creates a sense of depth and realism, drawing the viewer into the scene. The painting is notable for its technical skill, with Sirani masterfully capturing the textures of the fabrics and the expression on Portia's face. “Portia Wounding Her Thigh” is a testament to Sirani's talent as an artist and her ability to bring to life the complex emotions and themes of classical literature.</p>

                <img src="The_Anatomy_Lesson.jpg" alt="Artwork 7">
                <h3> The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp (1632) | Rembrandt van Rijn </h3>
                <p>The painting depicts Dr. Tulp, a prominent Amsterdam physician, conducting an anatomy lesson on the body of a criminal, with members of the Amsterdam Guild of Surgeons looking on. The painting is a striking example of Rembrandt’s mastery of light and shadow, with the figure of Dr. Tulp standing out in sharp relief against a dark background, and the faces of the onlookers illuminated by a single light source.

The painting is notable for its realism and attention to detail, with Rembrandt meticulously rendering the anatomical features of the cadaver and the various tools and instruments used by the surgeons. The painting also reflects the growing interest in science and medicine during the 17th century, as well as the broader cultural fascination with death and the human body. “The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicholaes Tulp” is a powerful and evocative work of art that continues to captivate viewers with its combination of technical skill, intellectual curiosity, and emotional resonance.</p>
